Test -endian on differnt machines. Pay attention to Time.
Add another argument for 'getSaHpiSession' - domain_id. 
Write RFE  for the UNSUPPORTED function. - Tags in RPT
Update the MIB to reflect the fact that SaHpiHsStateT is also in the event - perhpas remove PreviousHotSwapState ?
saHpiHotSwapResetState - not sure if the fourht state - resetDeassert- is allowed under SAF HPI?
Replace in set_action 'SNMP_ERR_GENERR' with SNMP_ERR_INCONSISTENTVALUE

The Event row might be shortnened? Perhaps have the OID to the resource, and some of the information?
In the EVENT code - add DEBUGMSGTL for the SET mechanism
Perhaps write a struct for the saHpiDomainID, saHpiResourceIdT, oids, and such to pass that instead of individual entries?
