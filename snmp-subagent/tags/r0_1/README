This is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's 
Hardware Platform Interface SNMP sub-agent.

Through this subagent one can includes support for multiple different 
types of hardware including: IPMI, IBM Blade Center (via SNMP), 
Linux Watchdog devices, and Sysfs based systems.

---------------------------------------------------------
WARNING/NOTE
---------------------------------------------------------

*NOTE*: The OID of the HPI-MIB v1.3 is 'experimental.90'
This MIB branch location *WILL* change in the next
release. Consider this a technology review code.

---------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------
The following software is required to build openhpi

any HPI 1.0 implementation that is based on SAF specification 
	SAI-HPI-A.01.01. Recommended: openhpi >= 0.4
autoconf >= 2.50
automake >= 1.5
net-snmp >= 5.0.x
GLIB-1.2	(note we may be switching to 2.0 in the next release)

---------------------------------------------------------
BUILD / INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------
First time to extract the code:
run ./boostrap

This will generate all files needed to compile.

after running the bootstrap script, run:
	./configure

then make (or make rpm)
and then (as root or with proper system install permissions)
	make install (or install from the rpm).

It will generate the subagent code and put the configuration file 
- hpiSubagent.conf in the NetSNMP configuration directory.

---------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
---------------------------------------------------------
To remove the temporary build files, type:

make clean

If you are a maintainer, and need to remove all autogenerated files, type:

make clean
make maintainer-clean
